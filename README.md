# Region Chart Viz
A line chart visualization that supports data-driven, colored regions.

Can be used to show:
* configured thresholds
* the spread of data (for example using standard deviation/interquartile range)
* where data might be incomplete (because it is still arriving)
* maintenance periods
* business hours

Provide valuable context to your line charts. Built with D3.
